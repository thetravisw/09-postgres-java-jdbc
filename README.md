## Resources  
* [HTML Postgres Cheat Sheet](http://www.postgresonline.com/special_feature.php?sf_name=postgresql83_cheatsheet&outputformat=html)
* [Postgres CLI (Command Line Interface)](https://www.pgcli.com/)
* [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/)

## Feature Tasks
Create a Java command line tool that interacts with the world database. Allow
users to search for countries, cities, populations, languages or whatever you
want.

You must construct at least these following types of queries:

* One query that returns all cities or countries.
* One query that returns cities or countries constrained by one parameter.
* One query that returns results constrained by at least two parameters.
* One query that returns results based on an SQL join.

## Project Structure
Your project must have the following classes:

* `Main` - the bulk of the program. Deals with ALL input/output.
* `WorldDB` - creates methods used by Main that query the database.
* `City` - models the properties of a city
* `Country` - models the properties of a country

## Testing
Create unit tests to make sure your `WorldDB` class retrieves simple known
information property for each of your queries.
